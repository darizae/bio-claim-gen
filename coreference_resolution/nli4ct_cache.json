Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment protocol.   Provide written informed consent.   Females, age >/= 18 years.   Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use a highly effective methods of contraception (eg, condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intra-uterine device, or have a vasectomised partner) having started for at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting eribulin and throughout the entire treatment period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of eribulin. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.   Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the treatment protocol:   Eligible for any other eribulin study that is open in the same region.   Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of Grade >/= 2, except that alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable.   History of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association Classification >II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, serious cardiac arrhythmia.   Electrocardiogram with QTc interval >/= 500 msec based upon Bazett's formula (QTcB).   The Investigator believes the subject to be medically unfit to receive eribulin or unsuitable for any other reason.   Females who are pregnant (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding.   Subject with hypersensitivity to eribulin or any of the excipients.   Subjects with brain or subdural metastases are not eligible, unless they have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this treatment protocol. Any signs (eg, radiologic) and/or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting the treatment protocol.   Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the subject's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol.   Subjects who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive because the neutropenia caused by the eribulin treatment may make such subjects particularly susceptible to infection.   Subjects with meningeal carcinomatosis.   Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement that results in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active treatment, including the use of oxygen.   Subjects who have received any of the following treatments within the specified period before the start of treatment:   Any investigational drug, chemotherapy, radiation, or biological or targeted therapy within 2 weeks.

Participants should have received only 1 line of platinum-containing treatment for metastatic disease (i.e., adjuvant treatment with a platinum-containing regimen is not sufficient for eligibility because not received in the context of a metastatic disease). Participants in the NSCLC cohort will only be enrolled in USA   NSCLC first line: Stage IV (per 7th International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] classification) or recurrent NSCLC that is histologically proven. Participants must not have received treatment for their metastatic or recurrent disease. No activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation nor ALK translocation/re-arrangement   Gastric and GEJ cancer: Histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastric and gastro-esophageal junction, treated with first-line chemotherapy combination with or without disease progression. Participants should have received no more than 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease. Participants should not have been treated with trastuzumab (but can be Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 [HER2] positive). Participants who received any platinum containing doublet or triplet as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy, but are not ultimately candidates for surgery will also be eligible, as long as they did not have progressive disease after completion of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, participants with gastric cancer can enter in the study if their white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte count is as defined in the protocol   MBC: Participants must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or MBC and have tumor that is refractory to or progressive after standard of care therapy.

Treatment should be started within 90 days of the final surgical procedure for breast cancer.   Patients may have bilateral synchronous breast tumors. Patients may have received hormonal therapy for the purpose of chemoprevention but must be willing to discontinue prior to enrollment and while participating in this trial.   If patients have peripheral neuropathy, it must be  grade 1.   Patients must be willing to discontinue sex hormonal therapy e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc., prior to enrollment.

Treated brain metastases are defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose) are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

  "  Objective Response Rate (ORR)   ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using independent imaging review (IIR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. BOR of CR and PR was confirmed by a subsequent CR assessment and CR or PR assessment, respectively at least 4 weeks later. CR: disappearance of all measurable, non-measurable lesions and no unequivocal new lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD and there are no unequivocal new lesions, and no progression of non-target disease. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated by Clopper-Pearson method. As planned, data up to the primary completion date only were analyzed.
