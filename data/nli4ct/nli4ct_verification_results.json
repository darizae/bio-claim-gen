Those with at least 2 treatment cycles remaining of the 18-cycle treatment course after the crossover period were offered the opportunity to self-administer SC Herceptin via SID under the direction of a trained HCP. The SC dose was 600 mg for all cycles where SC Herceptin was given, and the IV dose was 6 mg/kg for all cycles where IV Herceptin was given.

Targeted lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which were then assessed by the investigator based on RECIST. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Possible CR and PR had to be confirmed no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial response assessment. A brain and bone scan was performed by CT/MRI within 1 week after confirmation of a response to ensure no new metastases. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat evaluations, to be performed not fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria were first met.

The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same participant. A log (base 10) ratio of expression in the post-dose sample was generated relative to the reference in both the Up and DOWN arms of the gene signature. A log ratio value of zero indicated no change in the expression between the two samples. GFS was calculated as the mean log ratio of genes in the UP arm minus mean log ratio of genes in the Down arm. GFS was compared for paired samples (pre-dose and post-dose) by a T-statistic calculated as the GFS divided by its standard error. Responders to therapy had a T-statistic that was smaller than the threshold 1st percentile of student's T-distribution and were counted as having a decrease in GFS.

The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same participant. A log (base 10) ratio of expression in the post-dose sample was generated relative to the reference in both the Up and DOWN arms of the gene signature. A log ratio value of zero indicated no change in the expression between the two samples. GFS was calculated as the mean log ratio of genes in the UP arm minus mean log ratio of genes in the Down arm. GFS was compared for paired samples (pre-dose and post-dose) by a T-statistic calculated as the GFS divided by its standard error. Responders to therapy had a T-statistic that was smaller than the threshold 1st percentile of student's T-distribution and were counted as having a decrease in GFS.
