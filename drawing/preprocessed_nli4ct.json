      "  The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Targeted lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which were then assessed by the investigator based on RECIST. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Possible CR and PR had to be confirmed no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial response assessment. A brain and bone scan was performed by CT/MRI within 1 week after confirmation of a response to ensure no new metastases. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat evaluations, to be performed not fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria were first met. ORR = CR + PR",

      "  OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a confirmed CR or PR, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, v 1.0). Best OR is defined as the best response recorded from the start of treatment until progressive disease (PD)/recurrence. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of TLs, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD and no PD, or complete resolution of TLs and the persistence of one or more non-TL(s), as assessed by the IRC. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of >= 1 new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Responses were confirmed at subsequent assessments made >=28 days after the original response. Participants with an unknown or missing response are treated as non-responders.",

      "  GFS was measured by microarray analysis of the entire 101 gene signature expression. The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same participant. A log (base 10) ratio of expression in the post-dose sample was generated relative to the reference in both the Up and DOWN arms of the gene signature. A log ratio value of zero indicated no change in the expression between the two samples. GFS was calculated as the mean log ratio of genes in the UP arm minus mean log ratio of genes in the Down arm. GFS was compared for paired samples (pre-dose and post-dose) by a T-statistic calculated as the GFS divided by its standard error. Responders to therapy had a T-statistic that was smaller than the threshold 1st percentile of student's T-distribution and were counted as having a decrease in GFS.",

Performance speed is measured for Detection/Identification/Monitoring and performance accuracy is measured for Memory/Learning/ISLT/ISLT-Delayed Recall. Performance speed calculated as mean of the log10 transformed reaction time for correct responses (lower score=better); performance accuracy calculated as arcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses (higher scores=better). Main outcome measure is a composite score (average of task scores after transformation and standardization by age-specific norms).

Prior radiation to the whole pelvis is not allowed.
